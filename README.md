# Terminologies
* Outside-In Tracking: Tracking camera is mounted on a wall or on a tripod. Heading tracking is done by calculating the head tracking blob position.
* Inside-Out Tracking: Tracking camera is mounted on the HMD. Heading tracking is done by calculating HMD relative positon to external stationary marker blob.
